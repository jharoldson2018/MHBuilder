Monster Hunter World Comprehensive User Interface Build Guide System

The goal of my project is to make a Comprehensive database with the weapons, armor, and other misc.
items with a front end that the users can use to search the database to make their own builds of various types
for different weapons to test which abilities they might need, materials they need to make said equipment.

things i might need
database to store equipment - including statistics for the weapon including sharpness,
damage types, damage numbers, material costs, upgrade from and to, armor traits, etc.

front end UI - shows which items are currently equip, item set inventory, list of builds, login/logout

admin/IT to add or update database for expansion content

for CS upscaling - i thought about porting this to mobile and hopefully make it function well on mobile
